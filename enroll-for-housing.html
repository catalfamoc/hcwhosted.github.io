      <h2 class="display-5">Share your quarantine experience</h2>
      <p class="lead"> Many healthcare workers are trying to decide whether to self-quarantine.</p> 
      <p class="lead"> By participating voluntarily in a research study of frontline health care workers, 
        you will provide data on the impact of self-quarantine, to improve pandemic preparation and to 
        optimize outcomes for patients, clinicians, and the community.</p>
      <p class="lead"> The <strong>Voluntary Self-Quarantine (VOSQUA) research study</strong> is NOT required to 
        participate in the HCW HOSTED cohort or to receive housing and resources.</p> 

      <p class="lead"> If you are interested in participating in a short baseline survey, click the link below. </p>
      <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://redcap.link/vosqua" role="button">Optional Enrollment in VOSQUA study &raquo;</a>
      <p><small> An Institutional Review Board responsible for human subjects research at The University of Arizona reviewed this research project and found it to be acceptable, according to applicable state and federal regulations and University policies designed to protect the rights and welfare of participants in research.</small></p>

      <h2 class="display-5">Reduced Rate Housing</h2>
      <p class="lead"> The goals of HCW HOSTED are to provide free housing during the COVID-19 response, to support your mental 
        health, and ensure your family's overall well being. That said, the free housing HCW HOSTED finds may not be ideal to your specific needs.</p>
      <p class="lead"> There are other options out there. Private rental organizations and hotels have already begun to support responders. 
        Below are listed reduced rate ($) hotel and housing resources you might also consider. HCW HOSTED is here to help you find any housing
        and will provide you and your family all the same support during the COVID-19 response effort.</p>
  
      <h2 class="display-6">Airbnb</h2>
        <p class="lead">Airbnb is offering no-fees on housing for COVID-19 first responders, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/covid19relief-guests">find available rental properties here</a>.</p>
        <p class="lead">If you want to offer your property via Airbnb, you can <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/openhomes/covid19relief">Offer your space or donate ($) here</a>.</p>
      
      <h2 class="display-6">Hotels</h2>
        <p class="lead"> <a href="https://www.visittucson.org/meetings/covid-19-updates">VISIT Tucson</a> has 
          identified over forty local hotels offering reduced rates and services to COVID-19 responders.</p> 
        <p class="lead"> Many hospital human resources departments are working directly with large hotel groups to obtain free or reduced nightly rates.
          Contact your HR department to see what resources are available.</p>
        <p class="lead">HCW HOSTED can help get you into a hotel of your preference, after we have your enrollment information.</p>
