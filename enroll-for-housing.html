      <h3>Are you willing to share your quarantine experience with science?</h3>
      <p>Many healthcare workers are trying to decide whether to self-quarantine. By participating voluntarily in a research study of frontline health care workers, you will provide data on the impact of self-quarantine, to improve pandemic preparation and to optimize outcomes for patients, clinicians, and the community.</p>
      <p>The Voluntary Self-Quarantine (VOSQUA) research study is NOT required to participate in the HCW HOSTED cohort or to receive housing and resources. If you are interested, you will be directed to a link at the end of the enrollment form.</p>
      <p>An Institutional Review Board responsible for human subjects research at The University of Arizona reviewed this research project and found it to be acceptable, according to applicable state and federal regulations and University policies designed to protect the rights and welfare of participants in research.</p>
