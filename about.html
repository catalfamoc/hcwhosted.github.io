                <p class="text-justified"><strong>HCW HOSTED: Coordinating Community Support for Healthcare Workers (HCWs) and their families</strong> is an initiative created with a threefold mission: 
                  <ul>
                  <p class="text-justified">1. Coordination of comfortable, free and/or affordable housing for health-care workers away from their families.</p>
                  <ul> 
                    <p> All health-care workers including physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, environmental specialists and others on the front lines are invited to participate. Those who register with HCW HOSTED will have access to community support resources. We will provide the service of monitoring your health status through daily text messages and/or emails to enable appropriate housing based on your COVID-19 symptoms and/or testing status.</p>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="text-justified">2. Coordination of support services for health-care worker's families.</p> 
                  <ul>
                  <p>HCW HOSTED provides mental health and wellness support services for the spouses/partners of health-care workers and their children. This website has links to <a href="wellness-resources" target="_blank">mental health and other support services</a> and information for health-care workers, who can use these services regardless of whether they are participating in housing opportunities.</p>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="text-justified">3. Coordination community involvement.</p>
                  <ul>
                  <p> Our initiative is responsive to the feedback of health-care workers. As we learn more about their needs, we will mobilize community resources to respond in constructive and timely ways</p>

            <h2 class="display-4">Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We envision healthcare systems that recognize the value and impact of maintaining the physical and mental well-being of healthcare workers and their families, enabling them to deliver high quality healthcare services to our communities.
</p>      
            <h2 class="display-4">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To build technology and community-based services that enable healthcare organizations to ensure healthcare worker, family, and community well-being. 
</p>
            <h2 class="display-4">Our Guiding Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>We are evidence-based</strong></p>
            <p>We adopt, adapt, and evaluate evidence-based tools and strategies to enable healthcare organizations to provide emotional and physical support to healthcare workers and their families.
</p>              
            <p><strong>Our focus is comprehensive</strong></p>
            <p>We serve all healthcare workers from environmental services and clinical administrative staff to nurses and physicians. We work with all healthcare organizations, including home health, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. 
</p>
            <p><strong>We are household - centered</strong></p>
            <p>Healthcare workers and their household members are the focus of our support activities.</p>
            <p><strong>We are community-based</strong></p>
            <p>We mobilize community assets to better prepare for and respond to pandemics and other emergencies now and in the future.</p>
            <p><strong>We advocate for health citizenship</strong></p>
            <p>Human rights and civic responsibility, key components of health citizenship, are necessary for a healthy population. Active community participation in promoting health, preventing disease, reducing health disparities, and supporting healthcare workers ensures collective wellbeing.</p>
            <p><strong>We endorse the independent goals of the “quadruple aim” in healthcare</strong></p>
            <p>Core to our mission are: (1) enhancing patient experience and safety, (2) improving population health, (3) reducing costs and preventing loss of revenue, and (4) improving safety, wellness, and satisfaction of healthcare workers.</p>
