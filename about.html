            <h2 class="">Why is CVSQ housing important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The ability to protect physicians and their families is a big factor in the resilience of the healthcare system. Cohorted volunteer self quarantine (CVSQ) can reduce transmission in the Healthcare Workforce (HCW) families.
</li>
<li>Psychosocial support in CVSQ may also reduce trauma and PTSD in the HCW and among their families. </li>
<li>The way the COVID-19 outbreak was ended in China was by isolating healthcare workers. </li>
