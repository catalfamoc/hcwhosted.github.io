            <h2 class="">Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Our work:
            </p>

            <p>
                We are partnering with the City of Tucson, Pima County, Tucson Chamber of Commerce, AirBnB, University
                of Arizona, hotels, and other community organizations to provide healthcare workers with convenient
                places to self-quarantine and prevent the spread of COVID-19.
            </p>



            <p>Initiative's effort</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To offer physical and psychosocial support to healthcare workers (HCWs) and protection for their
                    families and communities by providing dedicated HCW housing for HCWs in cities implementing HOSTED
                    throughout the
                    COVID-19 pandemic surge.

                <ul>
                    <li>Quarantined housing (separate areas for 1) asymptomatic and working 2) symptomatic with testing
                        pending, 3) +COVID-19 not working, and 4) Post-tour of duty quarantine awaiting re-entry into
                        home</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Secondary service</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Instrumental support (food, laundry, etc) Social support, pysch support, monitoring (epi
                        surveillance)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="">Why is HOSTED housing important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The ability to protect physicians and their families is a big factor in the resilience of the
                    healthcare system. HOSTED can reduce transmission in the Healthcare Workforce (HCW) families.
                </li>
                <li>Psychosocial support in HOSTED may also reduce trauma and PTSD in the HCW and among their families.
                </li>
                <li>The way the COVID-19 outbreak was ended in China was by isolating healthcare workers. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="">Research Highlights</h2>
            <p>
                Efforts will provide an opportunity to study the impacts of transmission within
                physician/clinician/staff families, professional/personal wellbeing, and opportunities to improve
                pandemic preparation and response to optimize outcomes for patients, clinicians, and the community.
