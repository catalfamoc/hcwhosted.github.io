              Yes. HCWs at any stage of COVID-19 infection, whether asymptomatic, symptomatic, pending test results, positive for COVID-19, or tested negative for COVID-19 but at high risk for infection through exposure are eligible for housing.

              The goal of HOSTED is to provide housing for healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 to reduce risk of exposure to families, loved ones, and colleagues at no expense. There are no fees to eligible healthcare workers housed through HOSTED.

                <li>Cleanliness, self-check in (for as little contact as possible). It’s important to wait 72 hours between reservations to properly disinfect and turn over space (better language in <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/cleaning-guidelines-for-preventing-the-spread-of-covid-19-163">airbnb</a>)</li>

      <h2>Basis for Current Understanding & Assumptions</h2>
      <p>Unlike in many countries, clinicians in the US do not live on hospital grounds or in subsidized hospital/university housing. Many are trying to create plans for trying to minimize exposure risk to cohabitating family members without much evidence-base from which to find their decisions for minimizing exposure risk. Some clinicians are choosing to self-quarantine in hotels or other solitary situations that have the potential to have negative emotional and psychological consequences that will affect their ability to care for patients during this pandemic.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>These HCW-HOSTED guidelines should be seen as an investment in protecting clinical staff and their families. It will be critical to maintain an active workforce of skilled physicians/clinicians for the duration of the pandemic. The goal is to “flatten the curve” through social distancing and prevention/delay of exposure and spread of COVID-19 within our community. The inherent qualities of COVID-19 necessitate that HOSTED be implemented proactively.</p>
