      <h2>Basis for Current Understanding & Assumptions</h2>
        <p>Unlike in many countries, clinicians in the US do not live on hospital grounds or in subsidized hospital/university housing. Many are trying to create plans for trying to minimize exposure risk to cohabitating family members without much evidence-base from which to find their decisions for minimizing exposure risk. Some clinicians are choosing to self-quarantine in hotels or other solitary situations that have the potential to have negative emotional and psychological consequences that will affect their ability to care for patients during this pandemic.</p>

        <p>These HCW-HOSTED guidelines should be seen as an investment in protecting clinical staff and their families. It will be critical to maintain an active workforce of skilled physicians/clinicians for the duration of the pandemic. The goal is to “flatten the curve” through social distancing and prevention/delay of exposure and spread of COVID-19 within our community. The inherent qualities of COVID-19 necessitate that HOSTED be implemented proactively.</p>
